Indian Road Traffic Simulator


Things to keep in mind while implementing the code:-

	1.Parser for config(.ini) file which i will make.

	2.Best choice while writing code will be for each vehicle to determine its possible positions before hand at the end of each time cycle.
	  We can move layer by layer,first work on the cars ahead of all the others,then the next layer based on the position of the cars ahead of it
	  and depending on that place the car.

	3.Evaluate Possible Positions for a car, in one layer move from up to down while evaluating where to place the car.If it's not possible to 
	  place the car in the same lane,place it in the closest lane(either left or right as it is an indian road).

	4.If its not possible for the car to be placed in any of the lanes with its current state of velocity and acceleration,reduce the number of grids
	  it will move ahead by 1 and keep checking for possible positions again.Keep checking and reducing by 1 till a position is found.This is because 
	  it's the car's job to move as far ahead as possible.If it's not possible to move let the car stay in the same position.

	5.Because each vehicle will be taking a specific number of grids in the 2 dimensional matrix(for eg. a car will take 4 blocks),the width also has
	  to be taken care of while checking for possible positions.

	6.Ideally the redlight can be treated as an object of vehicle class only with 0 velocity and 0 acc with a specific position and which gains a 
	  high velocity and acceleration for it to vanish outside of the screen. This would allow us to implement a red light situation just like point 
	  Number 4. You may implement it in any way you wish though.
